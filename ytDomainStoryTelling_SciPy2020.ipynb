The JSON schema is designed to be a fluid mental model within the software. We chose to use JSON to represent the framework because it allows for a declarative programming approach and is a tool agnostic format. This current project is working towards a method for capturing and encoding domain knowledge as it is relayed by domain experts. \n"

    "This is the first step to investigating the mental model and code objects, attributes and inter-relationships that are shared across natural science domains including oceanography, climate and weather, neuroscience and geophysics. The JSON schema will be extended across domains and can be implemented in existing science software tools to support interdisciplinary lines of scientific inquiry with a dynamic and context driven framework. As we investigate how best to capture and encode domain expertise, we hope this work will be a model for future open source development and create a novel avenue for dynamic, and domain agnostic tooling."
